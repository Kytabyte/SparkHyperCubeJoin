# Apache Spark

This repository is a copy version of Apache Spark. We will add a new join
algorithm called HyperCube join to optimize some multi-way join cases such that all
tables can be joined in one round of shuffling. The original repository is
<code>https://github.com/apache/spark</code>

From Apache Spark GitHub Repository:

> Spark is a fast and general cluster computing system for Big Data. It provides
> high-level APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and an optimized engine that
> supports general computation graphs for data analysis. It also supports a rich
> set of higher-level tools including Spark SQL for SQL and DataFrames, MLlib
> for machine learning, GraphX for graph processing, and Spark Streaming for
> stream processing.
